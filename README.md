# pomegranate_disease_prediction
this repository contain the model of nn that predict the disease of pomegranate with the help of img data also it contain the model of leaf that predict the leaf disease and give the corresponding solutions of disease 

in detail

Pomegranate and Leaf disease prediction Ph.D. pro.
Plant diseases cause major losses to several agricultural and horticultural crops around the World. Therefore, methods for the proper diagnosis of diseases found in any part of the plant body play a crucial role in disease management. therefore the main aim of this project is to predict the disease of the certain fruits and vegetables as early as possible in our case we take pomegranates and make a model with the help of its picture that predicts if the pomegranate has any disease through its photograph also it predicts the disease of the pomegranate and the give solution that what to do for overcoming that particular disease also I implement another model that predicts the diseases of pomegranate leaf and give the solution. moreover, the models are made using TensorFlow and python. throughout this project, I learn many things about how to use TensorFlow for Machine learning also I want to mansion that I implement the classification technic of Machine learning, and to create the model I used the convolutional neural network (CNN) technic. and the main goal of this project was that we can avoid the loss and increase the
productivity of fruit.
